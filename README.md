Title: A new extensive library of PHOENIX stellar atmospheres and synthetic
spectra

Aims: We present a new library of high-resolution synthetic spectra based on
the stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX that can be used for a wide range of
applications of spectral analysis and stellar parameter synthesis. 

Methods: The spherical mode of PHOENIX was used to create model atmospheres
and to derive detailed synthetic stellar spectra from them. We present a new
self-consistent way of describing micro-turbulence for our model atmospheres. 

Results: The synthetic spectra cover the wavelength range from 500 Å to 5.5 μm
with resolutions of R = 500 000 in the optical and near IR, R = 100 000 in the
IR and Δλ = 0.1 Å in the UV. The parameter space covers 2300 K ≤ Teff ≤ 12 000
K, 0.0 ≤ log g ≤ +6.0, - 4.0 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ +1.0, and - 0.2 ≤ [α/Fe] ≤ +1.2. The
library is a work in progress and we expect to extend it up to Teff = 25 000 K.
